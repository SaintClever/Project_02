  -
Users should be able to create topics, and other users should be able to comment on those topics.

2) ~~Jake isn't concerned about sub-comments, for now~~

3) Jake also wants to be able to see what topics have the most comments.

4) Jake thinks it would be cool if users could vote on topics, and have the topics displayed based on popularity.
